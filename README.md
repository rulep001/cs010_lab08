# CS 10 - Lab 8: Functions Continued

## Overview
For lab, instead of completing exercises in preparation for the assignment, you will start work on the assignment ("Mathematics"), and submit your started file to the RSub lab submission area.

Assignment collaboration policy is in effect for lab exercises that deal directly with implementing a piece of the assignment. Please abide by the policy for the corresponding functions or exercises.

You should work in your private workspace, and start your assignment file, mathematics.cpp. For this lab, you must get the function acquireOperands working to get your lab score of 1/1. Be sure to turn in to the lab turn‐in area to get lab credit!

We require that you build a "skeleton" main with just a "return 0;" in it, and implement a single function ‐ you don’t even have to invoke it, the test harness will take care of that.

You may also utilize your main to test your program by invoking your function with various arguments. Either way, your main will be ignored when testing on R’Sub for the lab.
